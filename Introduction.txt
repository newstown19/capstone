HI,

This project compares crime rate and types in the city of New York and San Francisco. Since, being more cautious in some neighbourhood 
is better. This is a general problem faced by many, also from this project we can decide the level of security for our establishment.
The motive of this project is to find most secure place in either of the city and eventualy secure neighbourhoods for opening and running a buisness.
